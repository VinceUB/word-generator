# word-generator
It's supposed to generate a random syllable that is legal in English. You can probably tell by the variable names that I didn't bother too much with things like readability and debugging. So it might give you an illegal syllable once in a while. It might also give an exception once in a while. I'm too scared to re-read the entire thing
